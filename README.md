# Examination of US Religious Environment

Dataset: The data for this project was acquired from NORC, a research organization that produces an annual General Social Survey. The original dataset contained 710 variables describing a variety of aspects of American life. I chose a few to analyze in this project to maintain the focus on religion. 

There are three panels in this app. The first is an **About** screen giving the user basic information about the data and the app. The second is the **Plot** screen that visualizes the dataset in a histogram. The sidebar allows the user to choose between observations for nonreligious and religious survey respondents. The user can then choose which variable to be plotted, and the plot only includes the observations that fit the religiosity chosen above. The user can also pick a color scheme for the bars. The final panel is a **Table** panel that gives the user the opportunity to view the frequency of each unique response for the columns included in the smaller dataset I created.

This assignment took me about 10 hours I want to say, but probably longer it's all a blur now.
